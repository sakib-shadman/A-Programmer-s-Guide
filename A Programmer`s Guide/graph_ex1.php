           <h1>Storing Graph using Adjacency Matrix:</h1>	
		   
		   <p>In mathematics and computer science, an adjacency matrix is a means of representing which vertices (or nodes) of a graph are adjacent to which other vertices. Another matrix representation for a graph is the incidence matrix.

Specifically, the adjacency matrix of a finite graph G on n vertices is the n × n matrix where the non-diagonal entry aij is the number of edges from vertex i to vertex j, and the diagonal entry aii, depending on the convention, is either once or twice the number of edges (loops) from vertex i to itself. Undirected graphs often use the latter convention of counting loops twice, whereas directed graphs typically use the former convention. There exists a unique adjacency matrix for each isomorphism class of graphs (up to permuting rows and columns), and it is not the adjacency matrix of any other isomorphism class of graphs. In the special case of a finite simple graph, the adjacency matrix is a (0,1)-matrix with zeros on its diagonal. If the graph is undirected, the adjacency matrix is symmetric.

		  <p >  A graph contains a set of points  and a set of lines showing connection between those points . Points in a graph are called as vertices(singular: vertex; plural: vertices) and lines connecting the points are called as edges.  In our example each city can be represented by a vertex and their interconnection by edges.  We use V to denote the set of vertices and E to denote the set of edges. An edge may start from and terminate at same vertex. Such an edge is called loop. A loop connects a vertex to itself.

 

A graph can be directed or undirected. In a directed graph besides showing a connection, a direction using a arrow is also given to the connection. In an undirected graph, direction  is not there. Our above example is that of a directed graph.
